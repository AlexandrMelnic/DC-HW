The homework one consisted in:
1) Verify the graph connectivity through the methods of: BFS, Laplacian first eigenvalue algebric multiplicity and adjacency matrix irreducibility
2) Use MC simulation to estimate the probability for a graph beign connected for different random graph models.
3) Verify the Throughput under different settings for the Fat-Tree and Jellyfish data center topologies.
